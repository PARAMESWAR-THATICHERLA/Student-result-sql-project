-- 3. ANALYTICAL QUERIES

-- Q1: Show average marks per student 
SELECT s.name, ROUND(AVG(m.marks), 2) AS average_marks 
FROM Students s JOIN Marks m 
ON s.student_id = m.student_id GROUP BY s.name;

-- Q2: Topper in each subject 
SELECT sub.name AS subject, s.name AS student, m.marks 
FROM Marks m JOIN Students s 
ON m.student_id = s.student_id 
JOIN Subjects sub 
ON m.subject_id = sub.subject_id 
WHERE (m.subject_id, m.marks) IN ( SELECT subject_id, MAX(marks) FROM Marks GROUP BY subject_id );

-- Q3: Count of passed students per subject (pass mark >= 40) 
SELECT sub.name AS subject, COUNT(*) AS pass_count
FROM Marks m JOIN Subjects sub
ON m.subject_id = sub.subject_id 
WHERE m.marks >= 40 GROUP BY sub.name;

-- Q4: Department-wise average marks 
SELECT s.department, ROUND(AVG(m.marks), 2) AS avg_marks 
FROM Students s JOIN Marks m 
ON s.student_id = m.student_id GROUP BY s.department;

-- Q5: Students who passed all subjects
SELECT s.name 
FROM Students s JOIN Marks m
ON s.student_id = m.student_id 
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.name 
HAVING MIN(m.marks) >= 40;

-- Q6: Rank students by total marks 
SELECT s.name, SUM(m.marks) AS total_marks, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(m.marks) DESC) AS rank_position
FROM Students s JOIN Marks m 
ON s.student_id = m.student_id 
GROUP BY s.name;

-- Q7: Subject-wise highest and lowest marks 
SELECT sub.name AS subject, MAX(m.marks) AS highest, MIN(m.marks) AS lowest
FROM Marks m JOIN Subjects sub
ON m.subject_id = sub.subject_id GROUP BY sub.name;

-- Q8: List all students with their subject-wise marks
SELECT s.name AS student, sub.name AS subject, m.marks 
FROM Marks m JOIN Students s
ON m.student_id = s.student_id JOIN Subjects sub 
ON m.subject_id = sub.subject_id ORDER BY s.name, sub.name;
